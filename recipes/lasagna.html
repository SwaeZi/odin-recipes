            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Brown sausage and ground beef with onion and garlic in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium
                    heat,
                    cooking and
                    stirring until meat is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir tomato
                    sauce,
                    crushed tomatoes,
                    Italian-style crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, 2 tablespoons parsley, brown sugar, salt,
                    Italian
                    seasoning, black
                    pepper, fennel seeds, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into meat mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to
                    low,
                    and simmer
                    sauce for at least 1 hour (up to 6 for best flavor). Stir occasionally.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into a deep bowl and cover with very hot tap water; let soak for 30
                    minutes.</li>
                <li>Beat egg in a bowl and stir ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg
                    into
                    egg
                    until
                    thoroughly combined.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 cup sauce. Layer 4 soaked lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the
                    ricotta
                    cheese
                    mixture, 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the dish. Repeat
                    layers
                    twice
                    more,
                    ending with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Cover dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake until lasagna noodles are tender and casserole is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove foil and
                    bake
                    until cheese
                    topping is lightly browned, 10 to 15 more minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>
